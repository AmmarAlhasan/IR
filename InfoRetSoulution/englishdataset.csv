3035573_0	I suppose would have to contact the nearest embassy for that. There are many in the US. The link below has info on them.
3035573_1	Some passports not passprots (whatever that passprot) has a phone number to call.. For the travellers safety do not leave the airport, seaport, Holy Roman Catholic Church, under one of these you are protected by International Law. Even German SS, and Knights of the Cross, has orders to protect you.
1604266_0	Well if your in trouble..then to cover your butt.  Maybe you should tell us in what kind of situation..so we could give you more specific possible things that could happen
1604266_1	Lets resolve this overdue question by bringing it to a vote.
3780737_0	No one realy knows. Some say she may have died of over exhaustion.
3780737_1	I agree with the first answer.
284664_0	Your nose encounteres a smell. The olfactory nerves are stimulated and send an impule to the brain. Your brain intereprets this signal and then responds. In some cases,using motor neurons to move you away from the source of the odor.

3570140_0	cell organelles . plant cells have huge and less vacuoles. animal cells have small but many vacuoles
3570140_1	membrane-bound compartments within some eukaryotic cells where they serve a variety of different functions: capturing food materials or unwanted structural debris surrounding the cell, sequestering materials that might be toxic to the cell, maintaining fluid balance (called turgor) within the cell, exporting unwanted substances from the cell, or even determining relative cell size. The cavity that is the vacuole is considered nonprotoplasmic and the contents classified as ergastic according to some authors (Esau, 1965). Vacuoles are especially conspicuous in most plant cells.. . Vacuoles are typically filled with a liquid called cell sap, the composition of which can vary (even between vacuoles in the same cell), but is principally water. Water tends to move along concentration gradients into vacuoles. Vacuoles perform different roles in different organisms and these functions include the capture of food, the maintenance of internal hydrostatic pressure (store water), the containment of waste products, the maintenance of an acidic internal pH, the storage of small molecules and finally can enable a cell to elongate rapidly.. . Vacuoles also play a major role in Autophagy. Some of the functions of Autophagy (carried out by vacuoles) are:. . 1.Its main purpose is to maintain a balance between biogenesis (production) of cell structures, and their degradation and turnover.. . 2.Plays a major role in the destruction of bacteria and unnecessary proteins that have begun to aggregate within a cell and may potentially cause problems.. . 3.It is especially prominent in insects that undergo complete metamorphosis; larval tissue is recycled to become appendages in an adult insect.
3570140_2	vacuoles store water for the cell, and some other foods too.
3570140_3	Ugh, you have asked all these questions on the make up of a cell.  Instead of being LAZY, read your biology book and attend class, maybe then you won't need to cheat to get your homeowrk done.
3570140_4	A vacuole is membrane bound sac found in plant and animal cells that is used for storage. It also plays a role in intracellular digestion and release of cell waste. It has a variety of functions ranging from protection of a plant to endocytosis. Each plant cell also has a central vacuole, which is formed by the coalescence of smaller vacuoles. The vacuole is very important to the cell.. . The vacuole in plant cells is generally larger than those found in animal cells. In plants it plays a huge role in turgor, the stiffening of a plant due an influx of water. The vacuole is where the water collects in the plant cells, as the water in the vacuole increases so does the pressure in the cell. And if water is not added to the plant, the pressure in the vacuole lessens, eventually causing the plant to wilt. The vacuole must work in conjunction with the cell membrane, both fro increasing/decreasing turgor pressure, and also with phagocytosis.. . Another function or type of vacuole is the food vacuole. These vacuoles are formed forphagocytosis, or the engulfing of nutrients into the cell. The food vacuole is the whole in which the nutrients are pulled in. This allows the cell to gain and utilize large amounts of nutrients at one time, instead of little by little.. . There are also contractile vacuoles which are commonly found in fresh water algae. The contractile vacuole is used to pump excess water out of the cell quickly and easily.. . Other uses of the vacuole are mainly storage. Vacuoles can be holding places for organic compounds or ions. They can also be holding sites for metabolic by-products, that would be harmful if kept in other places in the cell. Vacuoles can also contain pigment to color a cell, which gives flowers their bright colors. They can also contain poisons or other substances to deter animals from eating the plant.. . A vacuole is very important to its cell as it has many important functions, each varied and necessary for the survival of a cell.
3570140_5	dmbangel1981 is right.  I mean it isn't gonna take that long to open up your biology book and look for the answer yourself.  You really wouldn't even have to look in your book or cheat for every single question if you paid attention in class.
383265_0	A Audi is a luxury car manufactored by Volkswagon in germany.The main Audi plant IS in Ingolstadt, Bavaria. Volkswagon also makes the Porsche.. . Relationship with Porsche. . The company has had a close relationship with Porsche, the Stuttgart-based sports car manufacturer founded in 1947 by Ferry Porsche, son of the original Volkswagen designer Ferdinand Porsche. The first Porsche cars, the 1948 Porsche 356, used many Volkswagen components including a tuned engine, gearbox and suspension. Later collaborations include the 1969/1970 VW-Porsche 914, the 1976 Porsche 924 (which used many Audi components and was built at an Audi factory), and the 2002 Porsche Cayenne (which shares engineering with the VW Touareg).
383265_1	Volkswagen does'nt make the porsche. Audi Was founded by August Horch. He also started the Horch company, which he left and started audi. The word audi is horch in latin. Audi and Horch merged with DKW and wanderer to form auto union. The audi trademark is 4 interlocking wheels, which symbolizes the 4 companies. After world war 2, audi became a new company that was independant until it was bought by volkswagen. In the 70s VW needed to replace their rear engined cars with something new so they started making volkswagen versions of audi. e.g. The VW dasher is an audi fox with some things that make it look different.
383265_2	You mean AUDI? They are an automobile manufacturer, like Ford and Chevy
383265_3	Audi is the name of an automobile company. It specialises in many different forms of transport. Audi is known to provide quality enriched cars that perform well on the road and have less break downs than other vehicles.. . Audi also has the "upper-hand" in the automobile concept market. Basically, they create some of the most exquisite concept (future) cars that will be released in the upcoming future.. . You may have seen iRobot, a film starring Will Smith, note that he drives Audi's concept car of the year.. . If you have browsed their website (http://www.audi.co.uk) you would find out more about Audi.
1607646_0	To be earnest is to be serious.  Earnest money is a deposit to show that you are serious about making a purchase.
1607646_1	It is a good faith deposit that is used as a real estate receipt in the purchase of real property.. . As an example if one was purchasing a $300.000 home one may make an earnest depost of $1,000 to be applied towards the purchase.. . As an example, yesterday I recieved two offers on the same property. Both offers were for $299,900, however one earnest depost was $1,000 and the other $8,000.. . As a seller what would you choose?
2270942_0	I would quess that you have a minimum wage job and are a bit under educated based on the way you phrased this question.. . I would suggest going back to school...
2270942_1	Equality and professionalism in the workplace is what all of us should strive for.  Supervisors should not take advantage or discriminate against any honest, hard working employee.  You do not clearly outline your problem, so I can only advise that you should prove yourself worthy and honest and then the respect will come your way.
2270942_2	even mine were the same & I feel that they do so coz even they r jacked by their superiors. But, you need not take everything they speak, if its not your mistake. . Its human tendency that they presurrize only those who couldn't resist.
2218811_0	A situation you cannot get back to.
2218811_1	It means it cannot be un-done.
2218811_2	To revoke something means to take it back.  Like you might take back something that you've said.  So irrevocable means you can't take it back.

2503865_0	The war is currently to stabilize Iraq,and basically to get a friendly presence in a very unstable and dangerous part of the world. As for why the troops are not home yet - If the US leaves now, Iraq will fall into complete chaos. The problem is 1. stay, and bear the brunt of the attacks by insurgents, or 2. leave, and let the country fall into complete chaos until some powerful warlord eventually unifies and takes over iraq.
2503865_1	The purpose of war is to kill people. Troops aren't home 'cause not everyone is dead yet.
3919885_0	Other than curiosity, people are also inclined to open things that are not familiar in their everyday circumstances because of the chance it is something worth looking at. Take for example a pop up that promises a vacation to a tropical island if the user clicks the correct answer. Because there is a chance it could happen (though there is a chance that negates that), the person clicks it even if that had been the 31st pop up they have encountered for the night.
3919885_1	Cuz we're humans and we're always curious.  You just can't sit there and decline an IM cuz who knows if it's your next love, or somebody you're going to hate, either way its like christmas, and i love surprises!!
1599015_0	Pharmacy, call one and they will answer. Please dont take or give anything with out the correct dosages, mlg and grm are different
1599015_1	ON the side that says, 'Directions'. It tells how much adults should have and how much children should have.
48260_0	Also, when you are making a request you can say O-mizu kudasai.  And if you want cold water in a restaurant you have the option of saying o-hiya kudasai.  Hot water is o-yu.  Your safe bet is o-mizu.
48260_1	Mizu or O-mizu depending on the situation
48260_2	There are several types of water. Mizu (me-zoo) is the most common way to say water.
3791007_0	Ok I am a chef and here goes in laymans terms. First buy quality meat, regardless of cost buy good quality meat prime is best, choice if you are on a budget and no less than 3/4 of an inch thick. Secondly, montreal steak seasoning is the only thing that should ever touch your beef. Now flash fring will dry it out, searing has no proven fact of locking in juices, if it is good beef it wont dry out, stay away from leaner cuts of meat, fat is flavor and moisture try a ribeye or t bone or porterhouse if you can, so keeping that in mind, get your grill hot around 350, once it's hot place steak at 10 oclock as if you were looking at a clock,5 minutes on one side and then while on the same side turn it 90 degrees or 2 oclock  and you will get perfect hatch marks. 5 minutes and flip. Now back to 10 o clock and cook for 4 minute and back to 2 o clock. Important let you steak rest for 3 to 5 minutes before cutting it, all of the juices need to go back into the steak let it rest and after the time is up enjoy.
3791007_1	I f you really want it to be well done, I suggest that you sear it in a grill pan (or on a grill) for two minutes on each side over high heat, after seasoning with kosher salt, freshly ground pepper, worcestershire, and garlic powder.  Then place in a 350 degree oven to finish it off for about 10 minutes.  Take out of the oven, cover and let rest 5 minutes before serving.. . I prefer mine rare, so I would never do this, but if you want it well done, that's the bast way to make it happen without burning it.
3791007_2	You could try using a meat tenderizer that you buy (it is kind of like a seasoning you sprinkle on the meat).  Or you can tenderize it the old fashioned way of beating it with a tenderizer/any sharp object.  Also, cook it low and slow.  Have you ever tried grilling?  I think a grilled steak is always the best.
3791007_3	Don't cook it until it's all brown ... you're burning it and will dry it out. Many well known restaurants that serve tender and succulent meat won't serve a well done steak for exactly that reason.
3791007_4	It starts with finding the best quality meat you can find/afford. Your taste for fully cooked beef also factors in as the firmness of the meat is directly related to how long you cooked it.. Searing (cooking at very high temperature at the start) helps to preserve a lot of the moisture inside the steak. Allow your steak to rest before you cut it so the juices do not spill and leave you with tough, dry meat.
3791007_5	why not ry asking a proffessional chef?...
3791007_6	Only turn it once and let it rest, ie leave it covered on a plate, for a couple of minutes after it's done. It will take a bit of practice to know the best time to turn it, but remember that the second side will cook a little faster than the first.
3832762_0	CalTech and M.I.T. in the United States and the Indian Institute of Technology in India.

172969_0	Eurorail?  You can backpack and hike around - check out Rick Steve's Europe Through the Back Door if cheap European travel.. . He has great "Do it yourself" guides for European travel.
172969_1	Try Tarvelocity
172969_2	Hostelling International,  I Go to this association hostels when i went to Japan, really cheap, clean and perfect if u only want to have a bed where to sleep at nigths.
172969_3	euroRail pass is the cheapest way to travel once you are there.. The cheapest way is to go directly to an airline's website and search the sight for lowest fares and dates.. . None of the travel sights sell tickets for all of the airlines...missing, most notably, are the low-fare carriers e.g. Southwest, airTran, Jet Blue, etc.. . Very often I've looked up fares on the travel sights and found what I thought to be a good deal. But then I'd go to a low-fare carrier's website and find a walk-up fare that is much lower than a so-called legacy carrier airline's discount fare that is offered by a travel sight.. . For ease though, any of the travel sights works fine. You'll pay more for the ticket, but won't have to spend a lot of time over several days checking each airline's websites.. . A list of all airlines websites and a eurorail link can be found at airlineflightinformation.com
